3 FEATURES

  Time :
  
    Be carefull, you only have 18 seconds to press 'v'
    If you go over this time limit the first moove you will not be played and the piece will fall instantly
    Each 10 turns the time you got to press 'v' drops by one second
  Scores :
  
    While playing you will earn some points
    You gain some points as follow :
      40 for one line
      100 for two lines

      500 for four lines
    At the end of the game, if your score is at least above the 10th of the Hall of fame, the game will ask you a pseudo
